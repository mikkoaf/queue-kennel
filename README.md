# Queue Kennel

This is a playground repository for testing how the Queue works in the Laravel framework. 

The overarching theme is dogs in a kennel. If possible, the Jobs are something a Worker in the kennel might be able to perform, with the dogs being rows within the database.

Anything goes, but keep it simple.

- Output to log
- Keep processes simple
- Tell a story with Queue features
